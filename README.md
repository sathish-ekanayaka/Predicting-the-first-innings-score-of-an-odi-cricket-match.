# Predicting-the-first-innings-score-of-an-odi-cricket-match.
A method to predict the score of a first innings of a one day cricket match is introduced by this project.
Ball by ball data from a set of past cricket matches are taken and they are analysed using a machine learning algorithm called decision trees.
Each and every step I have taken is commented in the code.
